# 9girlpy
Auto-download pics from 9gag.com/girl ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

WARNING: This code was written 3 years ago when I was in 10th grade. So shitty coding. I tested it today and it seemed to be working, so okay I guess. 

Coded for python 2.7

Make sure you have both the py files and the bs4 folder in one directory, [and python in the global path](https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path).

First run 

`python 9gag.py`

This will save the image links to a file called "gag.txt"

then run 

`python download.py`

This should download the pictures.
